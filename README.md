# My First Game Remastered

# What is this?
I'm glad you asked! This is a remastered version of my first game found at https://github.com/datWaffle21/Making-a-game. That repository is convuluted as heck so I decided to make a better, remastered version!

This is going to utilize more organized code with different packages for different styles of code(main, util). I also released a roadmap for which I would like to complete. For anyone thats interested, you can download the game and run it on eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) open the project and run the program! Any issues you find would be gladly appreciated! Please open new issues as you find them!
